A neat little charting program that runs in the terminal.  Usage:

	chart [<option>...] [<filename>]

It reads numeric values from <filename> (or in the absence of the <filename>
argument, or if <filename> is '-', stdin) and plots them on a chart that is
drawn directly in the terminal.

The input is to be formatted in lines of text as follows:

	[,]<number>[,<number>...]

Each line beginning with a number not prefixed by a comma is taken to represent
a new data point.  Each number prefixed by a comma (i.e., the first numbers in
lines which begin with commas and those numbers following other numbers on the
same line and delimited by commas) is taken to represent an update to the most
recent data point.

For example, try the following BASH script:

	#!/usr/bin/env bash
	y=0
	while true; do
		for i in $(seq 1 4); do
			y=$((y + RANDOM % 9 - 4))
			if (( $y > 127 )); then
				y=127
			elif (( $y < -128 )); then
				y=-128
			fi
			if (( $i != 1 )); then
				echo -n ,
			fi
			echo $y
		done
		sleep 0.5
	done | ./chart -s ohlc -t '$RANDOM' "$@"
